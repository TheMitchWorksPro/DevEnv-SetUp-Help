Edited file in local directory, saved file, did not add/commit on GIT yet - how to fix it?
- $ git checkout -- myfile.txt
- $ git checkout -- myDirectory
  - the "--" is current branch (in this case Master), and file we want is specified next
  - this one command checks out the file from repository and replaces working directory file with it
  - works on directories too as shown in above syntax
<br/>

File was staged (added to be committed) but now we want to edit it again:
- $ git reset HEAD file.txt
  - do git status and it will tell us this syntax
  - this will unstage file.txt and reset the head 
  - this step undoes an add file operation so we can edit more and re-stage it
<br/>

- $ git reset
  - will reset everything and let us add and commit again (which is often simpler)
<br/>

- $ git commit --ammend -m "my comment"
- $ git commit --ammend
  - w/ comment - this ammends the comment on last commit as well as adding new changes to it
  - if nothing staged (from previous add operations) - syntax above can change just the commit message
  - w/o -m: just adds new changes to last commit
  - can only affect last commit (most recent one) before we push
<br/>

- $ git diff -- staged
  - shows difference between what is staged and prior edit
  - can show what changed with previous action so you can check it before committing it to finalize the reversion change
  

Example of editing previously committed content (1 file at a time):  
- $ git checkout 6afab5e706a5327ca41336da1946759677eedb9f -- GitHub_Lesson4_UndoingMistakes.txt
  - this would checkout above mentioned file for editing from commit identified by hash ID
  - it should effectively revert file to this earlier version so we can edit, add, commit, as new version
  - video indicates first 10 characters of Hash is sufficient (don't need to copy whole thing as I did)
<br/>

Example of reversing all changes made by a previous commit:  
- $ git revert 6afab5e706a5327ca41336da1946759677eedb9f 
  - this should reverse all changes and commit the results
  - you will be prompted to enter the commit message (default text editor should pop up like during "git commit")
  - save and close your message and process will complete
  - this works for simple changes
  - can enable a switch (-n) so it stages changes but does not commit them - the you can add/commit manually)
    - help file says this is particularly useful when reverting more than one change in a row 
<br/>

Useful informational command:  what does head point to?
- $ cat .git/head
  - this returns a reference path like this:  ref: refs/heads/master
  - use cat .git/<ref path> to get SHA ID of commit head points to as in:
    - cat .git/refs/heads/master

## Soft Reset
- Important! Before using this, copy recent history from log into a new document.
  - once reset is performed, you cannot find the items in the log that you are "re-winding" over
<br/>

- $ git reset --soft \<SHA ID for commit to reset back to\>
  - Example:  $ git reset --soft 6afab5e706a5327ca41336da1946759677eedb9f
  - What this does:  
    - Head pointer moved to new location
	- if location is 3 commits back, then the two most recent will be lost when we add / commit current working
	- is like recording current work over some of the commits in the history log, but no content is actually changed
	- working directory is unaffected
	- staged commits (if any) are unaffected
	- is "least destrictive" commit

## Mixed Reset
- Important! Before using this, copy recent history from log into a new document.
  - once reset is performed, you cannot find the items in the log that you are "re-winding" over
<br/>

- $ git reset --mixed \<SHA ID for commit to reset back to\>
  - Example:  $ git reset --mixed 6afab5e706a5327ca41336da1946759677eedb9f
  - What this does:  
    - Head pointer moved to new location
	- if location is 3 commits back, then the two most recent will be lost when we add / commit current working
	- is like recording current work over some of the commits in the history log, but no content is actually changed
	- working directory is unaffected
	- How this is different from Soft:  
	  - staged commits are reset  
	  - our work is still in workin directory but is no longer staged to be committed
	  - "almost as safe as soft commit" - changes to content still there but now need to be restaged and committed

## Hard Reset
- Important! Before using this, copy recent history from log into a new document.
  - once reset is performed, you cannot find the items in the log that you are "re-winding" over
<br/>

- $ git reset --hard \<SHA ID for commit to reset back to\>
  - Example:  $ git reset --hard 6afab5e706a5327ca41336da1946759677eedb9f
  - What this does:  
    - Head pointer moved to new location
	- if location is 3 commits back, then the two most recent will be lost when we add / commit current working
	- is like recording current work over some of the commits in the history log, but no content is actually changed
	- working directory changes are thrown out
	- How this is different from Soft / Mixed:  
	  - staged commits are reset  
	  - changes to content thrown out - working directory now "matches repo" (matches point from log of reset)
	  - "most destructive" (changes to working directory are lost)
	    - Note:  "lost" ... but not entirely 
		  - if we preserved the history from the log before the change, for limited time, can still access it
		  - provided not garbage collected, can reset again with SHA-IDs from our copy of the lost history
		  - this can effectively get back the "working content we lost" provided that content was committed

## Resetting Local Repo To Match Remote Repo

This topic assumes you know all changes are wrong or unnecessary and you just want to make your local files exactly match the remote repository.  

Here's what commands to use:

  1. git fetch origin
  2. git reset --hard origin/master
  3. git clean -n -f
  4. git clean -f

How to use these commands:

Assumptions:  you did not rename the main branch so your remote repo is "origin/master".

  1. run first two commands
  2. command 3 is a check step, run it ahead of step 4 to see what will be removed (if any files in your local repo are untracked and not on the remote repository).
  3. if you are comfortable with what the 3rd command tells you will be removed, then run 4th command.  Otherwise, you can choose not to run the 4th command, or copy the files outside your repo to preserve them and then run 4th command (which will delete them to make your local repo match the remote one)
