# DevEnv-SetUp-Help

This project contains notes for setting up developer software and environments and related help content to get going on the applications. 
Though initially, this content was "my notes for me", they address gaps I encountered in attempting installation and learning of applications 
from resources available online that I felt might be helpful to others.  This content is not comprehensive, and is presented as is. 
Testing of proceses is done with the equipment described with each folder only.  <br/>

Want to add edit files or improve this content?  Collaborations are welcome.  

This is a work in progress first added to GitHub on:  11/13/2016 and added/edited somewhat sporadically since then.

#### Subproject folders:
- [Anaconda_win7](Anaconda_win7): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;files from setup of an anaconda distribution of Python 2.7/3.5 on a Win7 Laptop
